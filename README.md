# Teract

Teract is a minimalist issue tracking system that let's you interact with your users in a simple, transparent way. Teract is a .NET Core 3.1 application that uses a PostgreSQL database. It comes with a standalone web frontend written with Vue.js, but the well-documented REST API let's you write your own UI.

## Project Status

Please note that Teract is in early development!
